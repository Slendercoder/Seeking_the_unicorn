      We were interested in exploring how the members of the group
      coordinate with each other when they were given a task. As 
      you were playing the game, maybe you noticed that you and your 
      partner were able to make efficient decisions to improve the 
      score. We wanted to show that the members of a group can coordinate 
      with very simple communication in order to better achieve their task.
