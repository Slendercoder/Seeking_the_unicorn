    <h3>Please read them carefully</h3>
    <div id="instructions">
      <br>
      On each round, you and your partner will be shown a grid of <span id="Num_Loc"></span> squares. Your task is to say whether there is a unicorn hiding behind one of these squares or not.
      <br><br>
      Click on a square to see whether there is a unicorn or if the square is empty. At the bottom of the page you will find buttons for saying that the unicorn is present or absent. You can click on the â€œSubmit Final Decision" button when you have made up your mind and want to see the score.
      <br><br>
      On half of the trials there will be a unicorn present
      somewhere in the grid, and on the other half it will be absent.
      <br><br>
      When you and your partner click on the same square, it will become blue.  When your earned points are calculated at the end of each round, then you will get points based on whether you guessed correctly as to the presence of the unicorn, and you will have points deducted based on the number of overlapping squares that you and your partner click on.
